# Simple Web Application

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!  

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.  

Node application runs on port 3000.  

    
## 4. Test

Open a browser and go to URL

    http://<IP>:3000                            => Welcome
    http://<IP>:3000/how%20are%20you            => I am good, how about you?

I am going to make a sample change so I can trigger a automatic Jenkins pipeline
